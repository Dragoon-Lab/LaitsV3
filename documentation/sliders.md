# Add sliders to all parameters #

In the default canvas, every parameter will have a slider associated with it.
Alternatively, we could put all the sliders in the graph window.  I suspect that the
latter will be easier to program, and maybe easier to work with.
Another idea is that the graph window has *only* sliders for the parameters.
There should also be sliders to adjust the initial value for accumulators.

In author mode, in the calculations tab, there will be extra fields for the user to input 
values for the slider limits.  Default values will be 0 and 1.  These extra field would 
appear for parameters and for accumulators, so the initial value can be adjusted.

In the case where the limits have the same sign, should allow for the sliders to work on a 
logarithmic scale.  In author mode, there should be a checkbox for this.
