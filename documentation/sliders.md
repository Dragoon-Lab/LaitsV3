## Add sliders to all parameters ##

In the default canvas, every parameter will have a slider associated with it.
Alternatively, we could put all the sliders in the graph window.  I suspect that the
latter will be easier to program, and maybe easier to work with.
Another idea is that the graph tab has *only* sliders for the parameters.

In author mode, in the calculations tab, there will be extra fields for the user to input 
values for the slider limits.  Default values will be 0 and 1.
