# Node Editor Design #

If the node is type sum or product, then direct text input into the equaton box should be disabled.

Idea:  Separate model design from pedagogical strategies.  Generally authors should not make decisions about
teaching strategies, except to create extra nodes. Thus, authors should not specify the use of "Sum" or "Product"  versus "Function" in the Node Editor.
