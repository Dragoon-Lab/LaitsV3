## Node Editor ##

The node editor window has several tabs.
Proposed [class structure](Draft_Design_of_Node_Editor.docx) by Ram.

### Definition tab ###

### Plan tab ###

Three way choice between "function," "accumulator," and "parameter".
In the code, these should be represented as variables in case we need
to change terminology.

### Calculation tab ###
