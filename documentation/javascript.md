# JavaScript user interface #

## Frameworks ##

We need a framework.  See Wikipedia [article comparing JavaScript frameworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_frameworks). 
We need a framework with the following:

* 2-D vector graphics
* Charting
* Open Source license
* The equivalent of dojo mixin and extend.

There are other things we need but the above items most strongly
discriminate between the candidate libraries.

A [list of possible libraries](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7034) at stackoverflow.

[jsPlumb](http://jsplumbtoolkit.com) sits on top of either jQuery,
MooTools, or [YUI3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUI_Library).
If we go with another Framework, then we would have to interface this 
library with that framework.
