# Lessons Learned #
The Lessons Learned window displays a message (written by the author) to the student after they successfully graph a complete and correct model in the construction exercise.  The author writes the message in the problem statement and times window.  Problems which have a Lessons Learned message have a Lessons Learned button visible in their menu bar, initially disabled.  After the message has been shown once, the Lessons Learned button is enabled, allowing the student to read it again if they wish.  Dragoon should remember if it has displayed the message or not, and if it has been displayed once in this problem, the button should be enabled.  Otherwise, the button should be disabled until they successfully reveal it.
