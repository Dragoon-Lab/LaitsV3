### File changes ###

The forum is at `/home/laits/forum/` on the dragoon server.
There is a solo git repository in the home directory to
record file changes.

We will need to either merge this with the laits repository
or have it as a separate repository on github.
It could be also be made a submodule of the laits repository.
However, there is lots of stuff on the internet saying that
git submodules suck:

### Changes to database ###

### Changes using Administration Control Panel ###
