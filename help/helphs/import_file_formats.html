<h2>Random graph importer</h2>

The random importer imports a graph with a random structure. A dialog
is displayed when you choose this option. In the dialog, it is possible
to select a number of vertices and a number of edges. The edges is
randomly connected from one vertex to another until all edges has been
connected somewhere. The vertices are placed in the circumference of a
circle. It is also possible to change the distance between vertices in
the dialog.
<h2>Mathematica compatible graph file format</h2>

The Mathematica compatible file format importer imports graphs from a
graph file format that can be exported from&nbsp;Mathematica. This
format is a simple neighbor list with vertex position information. See
the information about <i>Mathematica compatible graph file format</i> under the section about exporters for more information.
