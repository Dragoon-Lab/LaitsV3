<h1>The properties menu and its content</h1>


  
<p>
  <img src="properties_menu.png"></p>
<p>

  	The properties menu contains menu items used to change the properties of the program and the graph. The <b>Show quickmenus</b>
alternative shows a submenu where it is possible to select which
quickmenus that are displayed. </p>


  
<p>		 
	 The dialogs that comes up when <b>Graph properties...</b> and the <b>Properties...</b> alternatives have been chosen, are described in the two next sections.
	</p>

 
	 
<h2>The graph properties dialog</h2>


	 
<p>
	 This dialog comes up when you select the <b>Graph properties...</b>
alternative. In this dialog it is possible to select settings that is
directly related to the graph. The settings is saved to the graph file
when you save a graph and loaded when you open a graph from a file. </p>


	 
<p> The dialog is divided in two parts. One is the list that is to the
left. The list contains a number of names of settings modules. To the
right, the currently selected settings module is displayed. To switch between
settings module click on the name of the settings module that you want to
change. To save all changed settings that have been done in the
different settings modules click on the <span style="font-style: italic;">ok</span> button in the bottom right corner. If you don't want to save the changes click on the <span style="font-style: italic;">cancel</span> button. The different settings modules are described in the sections below.
	 </p>


	 
<h3>Background properties</h3>



  	
<p><img src="graph_properties_background.png"></p>
<p>

		Here the background color of the graph is selected.
	</p>


  
	 
<h3>Default vertex shape</h3>



  	
<p><img src="graph_properties_default_vertex_shape.png"></p>
<p>
In this module you can select the default vertex shape. The default
vertex shape is the shape of the vertex that is inserted when you insert vertices. The shape that you select in the drop down menu in the top of the module is displayed under it.
		</p>


		
<p>
		There exists one shape called <i>DEFAULT</i> that is different from the others. The <i>DEFAULT</i> shape can be any of the other shape. Therefore when you select the <i>DEFAULT</i> shape it is also possible to select which shape that shall be set as the <i>DEFAULT</i> at the moment. If you have inserted vertices with the <i>DEFAULT</i> shape it is possible to change them afterward by changing the actual shape of the <i>DEFAULT</i> shape.
		</p>


		
	
<h3>Default vertex color</h3>


	  
<p><img src="graph_properties_default_vertex_color.png"></p>
<p>
Here it is possible to select the default vertex color. That is the
color of the vertices created with insert commands like clicking in the <i>graph window</i> when insert mode is on. The module is divided into two parts.  
	  </p>


	  
<p> In the upper part you can select the background color of vertices.
That is the color inside the selected shape that has borders with the
foreground color. One option is to use the graph background color of
the graph as the background color for vertices. If you unselect that
option it is possible to choose a background color by clicking on the <i>Select new default color...</i> button.
	  </p>


	  
<p> You can select the default vertex foreground color in the lower
part. The foreground color is the border of the shape that the vertex
is made up by. </p>


  	
<h2>The global properties dialog</h2>


	
<p> The global properties is the program properties that is used for
all opened programs. The global properties is saved in the file<i> .grapheditor/properties.xml</i> that is placed in the user home directory. The user home directory is the directory given by the <i>java system</i> as the home directory. The dialog's structure is the same as in the <i>graph properties dialog</i>. The different settings modules in it are described in the sections below.
	</p>


	
	  
<h3>Graph drawing</h3>


	  
<p>
	  <img src="global_properties_graph_drawing.png"></p>
<p>

		Here you can change some drawing alternatives for the graph. 
</p>

<ul>


   <li> If the <b>Antialias</b> alternative is selected the graph will
be drawn with antialiasing. That means that lines and shapes get smoother edges. Turn this off if the program runs slowly</li>


   <li>If the <b>Double buffering</b> alternative is selected the graph will be drawn with the <i>double buffering</i>
technique which means that the images is first drawn to an off screen
buffer and then to the on screen buffer. This will remove flicker
effects but can possible make the program consume more processor cycles
and memory. </li>

</ul>


		
	
<p></p>


	
	  
<h3>Look and feel</h3>


	
<p>
	<img src="global_properties_look_and_feel.png"></p>
<p>

	In this module you can select the <i>look and feel</i> for the program. A <i>look and feel</i> is a collection of settings that decide how the user interface will look and behave. Which <i>look and feel</i>s that is available depend on the java version the program is running on.
