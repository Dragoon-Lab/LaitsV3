<h1>Introduction</h1>

The program is a graph editor developed for the mathematical
field of graph theory. The program is crated on request of Klas
Markstr&ouml;m at the mathematical department in Ume&aring; University
as a Bachelor thesis project.

<h2>Purpose</h2>


The main purpose of the graph editor is to make it easy to edit and
create graphs that are used to illustrate theories and ideas in the
mathematical field of graph theory. Many graph editors exist but just a
few are developed with graph theory in mind and of them almost
none are updated. Therefore there is a gap that this editor tries
to fill.
<h2>Main functions and features</h2>



  The program's main functionality is to <i>edit</i>, <i>save</i> and open <i>graphs</i>. This is described in the help section <i>editing graphs</i>.
Other features are for example, graph operations and automatic embedding
algorithms etc. The functions are summarized in the following list:
<ul>



  <li>Functions for copying and pasteing part of the graph</li>



  <li>Functions for unlimited undo and redo editing commands</li>



  
  <li>View functions for zooming in and out the view of the graph and to center the current graph</li>



  <li>Selection function to select parts of the graphs depending on the current selection (e.g. select neighbours)</li>



  <li>Graph operations and other graph manipulation functions</li>



  <li>Export functions to export the graph to other graph file formats:
  
    
    
    <ul>



  <li>Graphviz dot-file format</li>



  <li>GraphML</li>



  <li>Graph Modeling Language (GML)</li>



  <li>File format compatible with Mathematica Combinatorica software</li>



  <li>JPEG image file format</li>



  <li>PNG image file format</li>



  <li><i>Mathematica</i> compatible file format</li>



  <li>Neighbor lists</li>



  <li>EPS image file format</li>



  
    
    
    </ul>



  </li>



  <li>Import functions to import graphs from other file formats:
  
    
    
    <ul>



  <li>Random graph importer that creates a random graph from a number of vertices and a number of edges.</li>



  <li>Mathematica compatible graph file format</li>



  
    
    
    </ul>



  </li>



  
</ul>
