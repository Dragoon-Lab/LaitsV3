<p>

The selection menu contains operations that are used to select different
parts of the graph. All commands except the <i>select all</i> requires that at least one vertex is
selected. Therefore they are disabled when no vertex is selected. </p>



 
<p> The operations in the menu are described below. The list is ordered in the same order as the menu items in the
selection menu. </p>


<ol>



   <li>The <b>Select all</b> command selects all vertices in the graph.</li>



   <li>The <b>Select neighbour</b> command selects all neighbour vertices to the currently selected vertices.</li>



   <li>The <b>Select reachable</b> command selects all vertices that are reachable by only <i>walking</i> on the edges from the selected vertices.</li>



   <li>The <b>Select other</b> command unselects all selected vertices and selects all previously not selected vertices.</li>



 
</ol>
