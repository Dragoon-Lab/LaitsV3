<h1>Export</h1>

The file menu contains a submenu with a number of different file
formats that it is possible to export the graph to. The submenu is under the menu
item called <i>Export to...</i>. Bellow are the different file formats described with referenses to webpages where it is possible to find more information.
  
  
<h2>Graphviz dot-file format</h2>


  
<p> This format can be used with the Graphviz tools produced in the
Graphviz project. The Graphviz tools can create images of graphs from
simple graph descriptions. The generated file is a description of a
undirected graph created from the current graph. See the Graphviz
documentation for information of how to change the files and configure
the output. Bellow is an example of a command that produces a
PNG-image file with a graph drawn from the description in the test.dot
file:<br>


  <i>neato test.dot -Tpng &gt; test.png</i>
  </p>

<h2>GraphML</h2>


  
<p> GraphML is an XML based file format for describing all types of
graph structures. Among other things it has support for both undirected and directed graphs. The generated file is a description of an undirected graph. </p>

<h2>Graph Modeling Language (GML)</h2>


    
<p> GML was created to make a universal graph file format that could be
used in all types of graph programs. It is possible to attach all kind
of data to the graph objects. </p>

<h2>File format compatible with Mathematica Combinatorica software</h2>


   
<p> This file format is a simple neighbour list with position
information for vertices. It can be opened with the Mathematica
software. </p>


  
  
<p> Each row in the file format represents a vertex. The first number
on each line is a vertex identification. The two floating point number
next on the line is the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the
vertex. The numbers coming after that is the identifications of the
vertices that are neighbours to the vertex. </p>

<h2>Neighbour&nbsp;list</h2>


   
<p>
   The files exported by this exporter are exactly the same as files that are exported by the <i>Mathematica</i> exporter except that they do not contain vertex position information.
  </p>



  
  
<h2>JPEG image file format</h2>


  
<p>
  When you export to a JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) image the graph is exported exactly as it looks like in the <i>graph window</i>
except that the selection is cleared. This means that if you zoom in
the graph the exported image will be bigger. The image exported is the
same size as the least bounding rectangle of all vertices plus an empty
border with 5 pixels. </p>

<h2>PNG image file format</h2>


	
<p>The PNG (Portable Network Graphics) export export is similar to the JPEG export
but produces a PNG image.</p>


	    <i>http://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG</i>
  
<h2>EPS image file format</h2>


    
<p> The EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) image files produced by this exporter uses vector graphics
which makes the images scalable. It is a very popular file format for
images included in e.g. scientific reports. </p>
