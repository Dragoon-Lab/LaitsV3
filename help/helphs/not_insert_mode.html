<h1>Not insert mode</h1>


<p>The intention of<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><i>not insert mode</i> (or <i>insert mode off</i>)
is to make it easy to move vertices and modify a currently existing
graph without adding new vertices and edges. It is also possible to add
vertices in this mode but it is much less intuitive than in the <i>insert mode</i>. To add vertices click with the right mouse button on an empty area and select <i>Insert vertex.</i></p>



<p>To move vertices in this mode it is just to press the mouse button
when the mouse pointer is in the middle of a vertex and drag the mouse
with the mouse button down until the mouse pointer is at the position where you want to place it.</p>



<p>To get a menu with commands click with the second mouse button in the
<span style="font-style: italic;">graph window</span>. The commands are different depending on the selection of vertices and
edges.</p>



<h2>Merge vertices</h2>


<p>It is possible to merge two vertices in the <span style="font-style: italic;">not insert mode</span>
so that the resulting
vertex is neighbour to all vertices that the vertices in the merging are
neighbours to. To merge two vertices press the mouse button in the
center of a vertex and drag the mouse so that the mouse pointer is at
the center of the
vertex you want to merge it. </p>
