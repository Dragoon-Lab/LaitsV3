<p>The main window has four head components that are marked in the figure above. They are described in the list below:</p>


<ul>


   <li>The <b>graph window</b> is the place where graphs are edited and displayed. How editing is performed is described in more detail in the section called <i>editing graphs</i>.</li>


   <li>The <b>menubar</b> contains a number of menus to choose operations from. They are described in more detail in the section called <i>Menus and their operations.</i></li>


   <li>The <b>toolbars</b> are used to fast access operations that are also in the menus. You can choose to hide the toolbars by using the <i>show toolbars</i> menu that is under the <span style="font-style: italic;">properties</span> menu. The descriptions below correspond to the toolbar with the same number in the picture of the toolbars above.
   
    
    <ol>


   <li>The file toolbar is used for some basic file operations. There
are buttons on it to create a new graph, save the current graph and to
open a graph from a file.</li>


   <li>The edit toolbar is used for some basic edit operations that
also exists under the edit menu. The edit commands in the toolbar are
for <span style="font-style: italic;">undo</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">redo</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">copy</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">cut</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">paste</span>.</li>


   <li>With the view toolbar you can zoom in/out and set the zoom-level to the default.</li>


 
    
    </ol>

  </li>


   <li>The <b>statusbar</b> is used to give varying information to the
user. As default the number of vertices and edges and selected vertices
and edges in the graph are displayed. The status bar is also used to
give hints to the user of how to interact with the program. In the
picture above the status bar contains a hint to the user during a graph
operation that requires several interaction steps.</li>


</ul>
