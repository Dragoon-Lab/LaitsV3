<h1>Introduction to editing</h1>

<h2>Editing modes</h2>

<p>There are two editing modes, one is called <i>insert
mode on</i> and another is <i>insert mode off</i>.
The current is indicated in the right corner
of the status bar at the bottom of the window. The <i>insert
mode on</i> is typically used to insert vertices and edges
into the graph. The <i>insert mode off</i> is
typically used to move vertices.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Ways to switch editing mode</h2>

<p>The easiest to switch editing mode is to use the <i style="font-style: italic;">space</i><span style="font-style: italic;"> key</span>
on the keyboard. You can also <span style="font-style: italic;">click</span> on the <span style="font-style: italic;">edit</span> menu and
select <span style="font-style: italic;">insert mode</span>H or right click in the editing window to get a menu where it is possible to change editing mode. Holding down the <b>A</b><span style="font-style: italic;">-key</span> wil temporaily change and it will only stay as long as you hold down the key. The<b> A</b><span style="font-style: italic;">-</span><span style="font-style: italic;">key</span> is intended for
situation when you only want to do something fast in the other editing
mode and after that go back to the original</p>

<h2>Selection and related commands</h2>

<p>
      nMany of the commands that can be performed on the graph are dependent on which part of the graph is selected. To select one edge or vertex <span style="font-style: italic;">click</span> on the vertex or edge you want to select. To select all
vertices and edges in an area you can press the mouse button in one
corner of the area and move it to the opposite corner and then release it. Press the <span style="font-style: italic;">control</span> button on
the keyboard to keep the selection when you are selecting more edges or
vertices<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span>
</p>

<h2>Delete vertices and edges</h2>

<p>
To delete vertices or edges, first select the vertices and edges you
want to delete, then use the <span style="font-style: italic;">delete</span>
or <span style="font-style: italic;">backspace</span>
key on the keyboard<span style="font-style: italic;">.
</span>You can also delete by using the delete menu item in the
menu that comes up when you <span style="font-style: italic;">right click </span>in the <span style="font-style: italic;">graph window</span>.</p>
