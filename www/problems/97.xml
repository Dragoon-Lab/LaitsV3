  <TaskDescription>Problem: Jack owns a trucking company that is not quite breaking even.  In fact, it loses about $1200 each year.  Jack sells one of the trucks for $50000 but after paying expenses, he has only $47500, which he puts into a bank account.  The interest rate of the account is 2% per year, which means that the money the bank adds to the account each year is 2% of what is in the account at the beginning of that year.  However, each year Jack takes $1200 out of the account to cover his losses.  
Goal: Graph the amount of money in the account over a 15-year period.
  </TaskDescription>
  <ShortDescription>Accumulator: money in account = money in account + money added by bank annually – money taken out annually
initial value = 47500
\n  Function: money added by bank annually = money in account * interest rate
\n  Given: interest rate = 0.02
\n  Given: sale price of truck = 50000
\n  Given: money taken out annually = 1200
