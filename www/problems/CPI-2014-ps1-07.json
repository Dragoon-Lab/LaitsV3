            "Suppose Mr. and Mrs. Walton start their retirement with $100,000 in their bank account. The interest rate is 5%, where “interest rate” refers to the proportion of the account’s money that thebank deposits annually to the account (that is, the account earns simple interest, not compound interest).  For instance, in the first year, the bank would deposit $5,000, which is 5% of $100,000.  Meanwhile the Waltons annually withdraw $12,000 for living expenses.  Construct a model showing how the money in their account changes.  Hints:",
            "* The new value for “money in the account” is the old value plus the bank’s annual deposit minus the Walton’s annual withdrawal.",
            "* The account starts with $100000 in it.  Dragoon doesn’t understand commas in numbers, so you must omit them. ",
            "* For this problem, you will sometimes need to use dollars as the unit.",
            "* The bank’s annual deposit each year is the interest rate times the money in the account that year.",
