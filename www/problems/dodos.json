The rats ate essentially all the Dodo eggs as soon as they were laid, so the Dodo birth rate dropped to zero. Meanwhile, the annual Dodo death rate continued to be 20%. That is, 20% of the Dodos died each year and no Dodos were born. Build a model and observe how the Dodo population changed over 20 years.",

           "* A node called \"deaths\" to represent the number of Dodos that die each year. To calculate it, multiply death rate by population.",
           "* A node called \"death rate\" to represent the fraction of the Dodo population that dies each year. Dragoon doesn't understand percentages, so we use 0.20 instead of 20%."],
