            "Zero Set Point Homeostasis",
            "This homeostatic system consists of a single quantity whose value is being controlled by the system so that it stays near zero.  When the quantity is above zero, the system subtracts 10% of its value continually until the value reaches zero.  When the quantity is below zero, the system also subtracts 10% of its value until the value reaches zero.  However, subtracting a negative quantity is the same as adding a positive quantity, so we could rephrase that last sentences as, \"the system adds 10% of the absolute value of the quantity to its value, thus move the value upwards towards zero.\"  Your model should have three nodes:","","1.  An accumulator for the controlled quantity, whose initial value is zero.","","2.  A function for the change in the controlled quantity per unit of time (this problem uses minutes).","","3.  A parameter for the rate of convergence, that is, what proportion of the controlled quantity is subtracted at each time.","","Test your model by varying the initial value of the controlled quantity.",""],
