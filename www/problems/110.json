        "taskDescription": "Problem: In 1900, there were nearly 4,000 million American Chestnut trees in the forests of the United States, but then the \t\t\t Chestnut blight arrived from Asia. By 1940, nearly all of the mature American Chestnut trees were dead. Let's assume that the \t\t\t blight kills about 10% of the trees each year. For instance, in the first year of the blight, 400 million trees died, leaving \t\t\t only 3,600 million alive. In the second year of the blight, 360 million trees died. \t\t\t\t Goal: Graph the number of live Chestnut trees over a 40-year period.(Unit is million)",
