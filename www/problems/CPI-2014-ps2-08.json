            "Suppose you work for a company that runs a strange retirement savings plan for you that is intended to keep you from leaving the company after you have become experienced.  Your retirement account starts with $1000 in it.  The first year, the company contributes 1% interest to the account (simple interest; not compound).  The next year, the company puts 1.5% of the account into it.  Thus, the interest rate on the account increases by 0.5% annually.  Construct a model that shows how the money in your accounts changes."
