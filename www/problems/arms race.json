Two countries, A and B, each have an annual arms budget.  Let’s say they both start with anannual budget of 100.  The change in the arms budget of each country depends on three factors.  The first factor is economization:  The larger the current arms budget, the larger the decrease because the government wants to economize.  Let’s say that both governments want to try to decrease the budget by 20% a year.  The second is fear of the other country:  the larger the arms budget of the other country, the more money added to arms budget.  The last is antagonism: the more the country hates the other country, the larger the growth in its arms budget each year.  Whereas money added due to fear is proportional to the other country’s arms budget, money added due to antagonism is a constant.    Let’s assume that country A really hates country B, so its antagonism is 8, and country A really fears country B, so the effect of fear is to increase A’s budget by 15% of B’s budget.  On the other hand, B is a more laid back country.  Its antagonism toward A is 5, and its fear factor is 10%.  Construct a model and explore how the budgets of A and B change depending on what their initial budgets are."],"givenModelNodes":[{"ID":"id1","inputs":[{"ID":"id5","label":""},{"ID":"id4","label":""},{"ID":"id2","label":"-"}],"position":{"x":722,"y":133},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Budget of A","description":"Country A's money budgeted for arms","type":"accumulator","initial":100,"equation":"(id5+id4)-id2"},{"ID":"id2","inputs":[{"ID":"id1","label":""},{"ID":"id3","label":""}],"position":{"x":838,"y":136},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Economizing of A","description":"Reduction of budget each year due to economizing","type":"function","equation":"id1*id3"},{"ID":"id3","inputs":[],"position":{"x":952.3309326171875,"y":123.3309555053711},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Proportion A economizing","description":"Proportion of A's budget dropped due to economization","equation":"","type":"parameter","parentNode":false,"initial":0.2},{"ID":"id4","inputs":[{"ID":"id6","label":""},{"ID":"id11","label":""}],"position":{"x":585,"y":135},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Fearfulness of A","description":"A's budget increase each year due to fear of B","type":"function","equation":"id6*id11"},{"ID":"id5","inputs":[],"position":{"x":885.3309326171875,"y":24.330951690673828},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Antagonism of A","description":"A's budget increase each year dueto A's antagonism toward B","equation":"","type":"parameter","parentNode":false,"initial":8},{"ID":"id6","inputs":[{"ID":"id12","label":""},{"ID":"id9","label":""},{"ID":"id7","label":"-"}],"position":{"x":728,"y":294},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Budget of B","description":"Arms budget of country B each year","type":"accumulator","initial":100,"equation":"(id12+id9)-id7"},{"ID":"id7","inputs":[{"ID":"id6","label":""},{"ID":"id8","label":""}],"position":{"x":853,"y":289},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Economizing of B","description":"B's budget reductions each year due to economizing","type":"function","equation":"id6*id8"},{"ID":"id8","inputs":[],"position":{"x":955.3309326171875,"y":273.3309326171875},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Proportion B economizing","description":"The proportion of B's budget dropped due to economization","equation":"","type":"parameter","parentNode":false,"initial":0.2},{"ID":"id9","inputs":[{"ID":"id1","label":""},{"ID":"id10","label":""}],"position":{"x":594,"y":292},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Fearfulness ofB","description":"B's budget increase due to B's fear of A","type":"function","equation":"id1*id10"},{"ID":"id10","inputs":[],"position":{"x":443.3309631347656,"y":279.3309326171875},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Effect of B fear","description":"Proportion of A's budget added to B's budget due to fear of A","equation":"","type":"parameter","parentNode":false,"initial":0.1},{"ID":"id11","inputs":[],"position":{"x":440.3309631347656,"y":118.3309555053711},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Effect of A fear","description":"Proportion of B's budget added to A's budget due to A's fear of B","equation":"","type":"parameter","parentNode":false,"initial":0.15},{"ID":"id12","inputs":[],"position":{"x":798.3309326171875,"y":415.3309631347656},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Antagonism of B","description":"Increase in B's budget each year due to b's hatred of A","type":"parameter","initial":5,"equation":"","parentNode":false}],"studentModelNodes":[]} }
