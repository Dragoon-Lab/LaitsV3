Hints: (1) The Done button is enabled (turns green) only when the model is complete and correct. (2) Although you could construct models by guessing and running them until the Done button is enabled, this will take too long; it is better to analyze the task and design the model using the advice starting on slide 67 of the instruction tab. (3) If you get really stuck or the software acts buggy, then please ask an experimenter for help.",
