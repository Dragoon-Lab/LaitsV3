      "Let's construct the Dodo population model that was shown in the video you watched.  Start by constructing an accumulator node whose description is \"The number of Dodos in the Dodo population.\"  Enter 1000 as its initial value.  Enter \"- deaths\" into the expression box by clicking on the minus sign button and then selecting \"deaths\" from the inputs menu.  When done, click on the Check Expression button and then on the Done button.  ",

      "Now  click on the triangular node, and make it into a function node whose description is \"The number of Dodos that die each year.\"  Its expression should be \"death rate * population\"",
