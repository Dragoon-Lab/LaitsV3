One loop lower blood glucose when there is a surplus by using insulin to tell the body to burn or store more glucose.  The other loop raises blood sugar when there is a deficit by using glucagon to tell the liver to add more glucose to the blood.  Just as with the generic two-loop homeostasis model, the key variables are defined as follows:","","glucose difference = blood glucose - glucose set point","glucose surplus = max(0, glucose difference)","glucose deficit = max(0, - glucose difference)","","The convergence rate for glucose surplus is 0.024, which means a glucose surplus has a half-life of about 30 minutes.  That is, half the surplus has been removed by the 30 minute mark.  Although less is known about the speed of the glucagon loop, assume the convergence rate for glucose deficit is even faster, 0.10, which corresponds to a half-life of 7 minutes.","","The normal blood glucose levels range from 80 mg/dL to 90 mg/dL, so assume that the glucose set point and the initial value of Blood glucose are both 92 mg/dL.  ","","\"mg/dL\" means milligrams per deciliter.  Use it throughout the model as the measure for the mass of glucose (measured in mg) per volume of fluid (measured in 1/10s of a liter).
