Use -9.8 m/s/s as the gravitational acceleration. If you haven’t taken physics, you will need to know that the change in height is velocity. That is next(height) = height + velocity. You will also need to know that the change in velocity is acceleration. That is, next(velocity) = velocity + acceleration.” ",
