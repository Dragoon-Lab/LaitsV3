In this configuration, the base current controls the collector current.  In particular, the collector current is beta times the base current, where beta is a parameter of the transistor and is usually around 100.  However, this assumes that the transistor is operating in its active region, which means that the base-emitter junction is forward biased and the collector-base junction is reverse biased.  For the NPN transistor shown and assuming the emitter is a ground, the base voltage is +0.7 volts (the knee voltage) and the collector voltage is several volts more positive than the base voltage.  Construct a model of the given circuit and graph the collector current as a function of the base current. "
