This particular model has a positive constant for acceleration.  It could be a negative constant (try it with the sliders).  In general, acceleration doesn't have to be constant.  For instance, it can be proportional to the Source, the Destination or Changing."],"givenModelNodes":[{"ID":"id1","inputs":[{"ID":"id2","label":"-"}],"position":{"x":463,"y":191},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Source","description":"Quantity of stuff in the source state","type":"accumulator","initial":100,"equation":"-id2"},{"ID":"id2","inputs":[{"ID":"id4","label":""}],"position":{"x":585,"y":191},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Changing","description":"Quantity of stuff that changes stateeach time unit","type":"accumulator","initial":0,"equation":"id4"},{"ID":"id3","inputs":[{"ID":"id2","label":""}],"position":{"x":706,"y":189},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Destination","description":"Quantity of stuff in the destination state","type":"accumulator","initial":1,"equation":"id2"},{"ID":"id4","inputs":[],"position":{"x":441.3309631347656,"y":50.33095169067383},"attemptCount":{"description":0,"type":0,"initial":0,"units":0,"equation":0,"assitanceScore":0},"status":{},"name":"Acceleration","description":"the increase per time unit in the amount changing","type":"parameter","parentNode":false,"initial":0.5}],"studentModelNodes":[]} }
