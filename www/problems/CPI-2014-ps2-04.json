            "Benny is in debt to the mob.  He not only has to pay them 0.2 Grand a month (i.e., $200) for renting a room in a run-down hotel, he also has to pay a monthly vig (interest) which is 10% of the debt. Fortunately, the mob lets him run up his debt; they don't break his legs every month.  They also let him work off some of his debt by killing people.  He kills one person a month, and for that, the mob reduces his debt by half each month.  Assuming Benny starts 5 Grand in debt, construct a model of how his debt changes. "
