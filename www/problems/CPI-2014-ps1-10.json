            "Suppose two large barrels are connected at the bottom (not at the top, as shown above).  After a heavy rain dumps 55 gallons of water into the first barrel, the water starts to flow from it into the second barrel, which starts empty.  The number of gallons transferred per minute is proportional to the difference in the amount of water they have.  In particular, when the two barrels have the same amount of water, the difference is zero and the flow stops.   Assume that the water flowing between the barrels each minute is 3% of the difference between the barrel’s contents.  Construct a model that shows how the water level in both barrels changes.",
