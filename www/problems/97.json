        "taskDescription": " Problem: Jack owns a trucking company that is not quite breaking even. In fact, it loses about $1200 each year. Jack sells one of the trucks for $50000 but after paying expenses, he has only $47500, which he puts into a bank account. The interest rate of the account is 2% per year, which means that the money the bank adds to the account each year is 2% of what is in the account at the beginning of that year. However, each year Jack takes $1200 out of the account to cover his losses. Goal: Graph the amount of money in the account over a 15-year period. ",
