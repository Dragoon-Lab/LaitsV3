        "taskDescription": " Problem: Rust destroys steel and can spread quickly. Suppose you take a large sheet of steel, such as one that might be used as the roof of the boxcar on a train, and you put it outside in the weather. Suppose it starts with a spot of rust that is 10 square inches in area. However, each week the rust spot gets bigger, as it grows by 30%. Therefore at the end of the first week, the rust spot is 13 square inches in area. Goal: Graph the size of the rust spot over 10 weeks. ",
