When Oprah weighs 120 pounds, then Jared weight 156 pounds (156 is 1.3*120). Note: Dragoon uses * to denote multiplication. To save you work, the nodes for Oprah’s weight and weekly weight loss have been defined already. Thus you will only have to define two nodes: * Jared weight: This is how much Jared weighs at the end of each week. * Jared extra weight: This is a factor that is used to convert Oprah’s weight to Jared’s weight.",
