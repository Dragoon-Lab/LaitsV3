    <TaskDescription>
        Problem: Suppose a city wins a large federal grant and uses it to buy 105 low-emission buses.  Although the buses have excellent technology, 
        they are driven all day long so 9% of them fail each week. Therefore, approximately 9 buses fail in the first week. Since the city does 
        not have the funding to increase the staff of its bus fleet maintenance facility, the staff can fix only 6 buses per week.
        Goal: Graph the size of the bus fleet (i.e., the ones that are on the road and not being repaired) over the first 10 weeks of operation. 
        A model has been provided for you and run. As you can tell from the G indicators, some of the graphs are wrong.  You will need to fix the model.
