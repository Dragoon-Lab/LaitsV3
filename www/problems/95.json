        "taskDescription": " Problem: Suppose a city wins a large federal grant and uses it to buy 105 low-emission buses. Although the buses have excellent technology, they are driven all day long so 9% of them fail each week. Therefore, approximately 9 buses fail in the first week. Since the city does not have the funding to increase the staff of its bus fleet maintenance facility, the staff can fix only 6 buses per week. Goal: Graph the size of the bus fleet (i.e., the ones that are on the road and not being repaired) over the first 10 weeks of operation.",
