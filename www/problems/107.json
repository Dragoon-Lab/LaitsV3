Each week Corky adds 7 new assignments to his task list. As hard as he tries, Corky is only able to complete 3 assignments each week and remove them from his task list. At the beginning of the semester, he starts with 2 tasks on his list. Goal: Graph the number of assignments on the task list over the 12-week semester. ",
