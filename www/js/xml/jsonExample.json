		"In this exercise, you will construct a model of how a rabbit population  NEWLINE
            grows when no rabbits die. The first quantity in this model is the  NEWLINE
            population or number of rabbits in the population. Initially, there are NEWLINE 
            100 rabbits, but the number increases with time. The new population each NEWLINE
            month is its present value plus the number of births (number of rabbits NEWLINE
            born each month).  The number of births is equal to the product of the NEWLINE
            population and the birth rate. The birthrate or the ratio of the number NEWLINE
            of rabbits born in a month to the rabbit population that month has a NEWLINE
            fixed value of 0.2.",
