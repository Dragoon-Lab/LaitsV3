  <TaskDescription>
Problem: Suppose a city wins a large federal grant and uses it to buy 105 low-emission buses.  Although the buses have excellent technology, they are driven all day long so 9% of them fail each week. Therefore, approximately 9 buses fail in the first week. Since the city does not have the funding to increase the staff of its bus fleet maintenance facility, the staff can fix only 6 buses per week.
Goal: Graph the size of the bus fleet (i.e., the ones that are on the road and not being repaired) over the first 10 weeks of operation. NEWLINE A model has been provided for you and run. As you can tell from the G indicators, some of the graphs are wrong.  You will need to fix the model.   </TaskDescription>
  <ShortDescription>Accumulator: bus fleet = bus fleet + buses fixed each week â€“ buses failing each week
initial value = 105
\n  Function: buses failing each week = bus fleet * proportion of buses that fail
\n  Given: buses fixed each week = 6
\n  Given: proportion of buses that fail = 0.09</ShortDescription>
